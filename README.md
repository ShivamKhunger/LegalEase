# LegalEase 🇮🇳⚖️

**Simplifying Legal Documents for Everyone**

LegalEase is an AI-powered web application designed to demystify complex legal documents written in Indian regional languages. The goal is to build an end-to-end system that makes legal text easy to understand, transparent, and accessible for anyone, regardless of their language or legal expertise.

## ✨ Key Features

* **📄 Text Extraction (OCR):** Automatically extracts text from uploaded legal documents, including both native PDFs and scanned images.
* **🌐 Multi-Lingual Translation:** Translates the document from an Indian regional language into English or any other user-preferred language.
* **🤖 AI-Powered Summarization:** Utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a clear and concise summary of the key points in the document.
* **🚨 Risk & Fraud Detection:** Intelligently analyzes the text to flag potentially suspicious, unfair, or risky clauses.
* **🎤 Interactive Q&A:** Allows users to ask specific questions about the document in their preferred language, using either **text or voice commands**.
